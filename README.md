### N-Grams and Language Models
- A language model is a tool that's calculates the probabilities of sentences.
- Language models can estimate the probability of an upcoming word given a history of previous words.
- apply language models to autocomplete a given sentence then it outputs a suggestions to complete the sentence
- Applications:
  - Speech recognition
  - Spelling correction
  - Augmentativce communication
- N-gram is a sequence of words.
